3. Create a class named NetIncomeCalc, Write a program that can calculate the salary after tax based on the following requirements
                the tax rates are:
                        35% for salary of 130K or more
                        30% for salary of 100K to 129,999k
                        25% for salary of 80K to 99,999K
                        20% for salary of 79K or less

                in addition:

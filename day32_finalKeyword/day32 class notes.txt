Warmup tasks:
	1. Create a class named Car
            Variables:
                make, model, color, year, price, numberOfWheels (static), hasBattery (static)

            Encapsulate all the fields

                start(): "Press the brake and twist the key to ignition"

                toString()

            1. Toyota
                	start(): "Press the brake and twist the key to ignition"

            2. Honda

IF the instance variable is final, we can only getter, we can not generate setter for it

Package name: lab10_classObject_encapsulation

Scrum Task:
    1. create a class named Tester
            Variables:
                name, age, gender, employeeID, jobTitle, hourlyRate

            Encapsulate all the fields
                Conditions for setting the fields:
                    1. name can not be set to null/empty/blank
                    2. age can not be less than 18
                    3. gender can only be set to 'M' or 'F'
                    5. jobTitle can not be set to null/empty/blank
                    6. hourlyRate can not be negative

            Add a condtsrutcor that can set all the fields when an object is created

            Methods:
                getSalary(): returns the annual salary
                testing()
                toString()


    2. create a class named Developer
            Attributes:
                name, age, gender, employeeID, jobTitle, hourlyRate , programmingLanguage

            Encapsulate all the fields
              Conditions for setting the fields:
                  1. name can not be set to null/empty/blank
                  2. age can not be less than 18
                  3. gender can only be set to 'M' or 'F'
                  5. jobTitle can not be set to null/empty/blank
                  6. hourlyRate  can not be negative
                  7. programmingLanguage must be one of those programming language:
                          languages = {"Java", "JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby", "C#", "C++", "Swift"}
            Method:
              getSalary(): returns the annual salary
              coding()
              fixingBug()
              toString()


    3. create a class called ScrumTeam
            Attributes:
                PO (String), BA (String), SM (String)
                testers (ArrayList<Tester>)
                developers(ArrayList<Developer>)
                daysOfSprint (int)

            Encapsulate the fields PO, BA, SM and daysOfSprint
                Conditions:
                  PO, BA, SM can not be null/empty/blank
                  days of sprint can not be 0 or negative

            Encapsulate tester and developers but ONLY generate getters
                (we do not set them by setters we will use add and remove functions instead)

            Add a constructor that can set the names of PO, BA and SM

            Methods:
                addTester(Tester tester): adds the given tester to the testers ArrayList

                addTester(Tester[] testers): adds the given testers to the testers ArrayList

                addDeveloper(Developer developer): adds the given developer to the developers ArrayList

                addDeveloper(Developer[] developers): adds the given developers to the developers ArrayList

                removeTester(long employeeID): removes the given tester from the testers ArrayList

                removeDeveloper(long employeeID): removes the developer from the developers ArrayList

                toString(): prints PO name, SM name, BA name, number of tester, and number of developers


    4. create a class called MyScrumTeam:
            1. create an array of Testers
            2. create an array of developers
            3. create an object of ScrumTeam and store the testers & developers above to the scrum team
